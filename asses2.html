                <h3>blue flowers</h3>
                <p>Flowers are colorful, pretty things that grow in gardens and parks. They can be big or small and come in many colors like red, yellow, blue, and pink. Some flowers smell very nice, while others do not have a smell. Bees and butterflies love flowers because they get food from them. We also love flowers because they make our world beautiful. We give flowers as gifts to show love and care. Some flowers only bloom in the morning, others at night. Each flower is special and unique in its own way, just like us. Flowers teach us to spread beauty and joy around us.
